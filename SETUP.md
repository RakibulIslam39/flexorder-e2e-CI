# FlexOrder Environment Setup (rtMedia-Style)

This is a simplified, focused setup following rtMedia's proven approach for WordPress plugin testing.

## ðŸŽ¯ What's Included

### âœ… Your Prerequisites (All Implemented)
- **WooCommerce Installation** via WP-CLI
- **Random Products & Orders** generated programmatically
- **WooCommerce REST API Key** generation with Read/Write permissions
- **Test Data** for comprehensive testing

### âœ… rtMedia-Style Architecture
- **`main.sh`** - Single bash script for complete setup
- **`.github/workflows/playwright.yml`** - GitHub Actions workflow
- **`.travis.yml`** - Travis CI configuration
- **`pre-commit`** - Code quality hooks

## ðŸš€ Quick Commands

### Development (Current Working Setup)
```bash
npm run test:ci:full
```

### CI/CD (Fresh WordPress Environment)
```bash
npm run test:flexorder:ci
```

## ðŸ“‹ How It Works

### 1. Environment Setup (`main.sh`)
- Creates fresh WordPress site
- Installs WooCommerce plugin
- Installs FlexOrder plugin
- Generates test data (products, orders, customers)
- Creates API keys automatically
- Configures environment variables

### 2. CI/CD Pipeline
- **GitHub Actions**: Uses `rtcamp/base-wo` Docker image
- **Travis CI**: Sets up WordPress environment locally
- **Multi-branch**: Works on `dev`, `qa`, `main` branches

### 3. Test Execution
- Runs Playwright tests against fresh environment
- Generates reports and screenshots
- Uploads artifacts on failure
